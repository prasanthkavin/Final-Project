# Final-Project
This project focuses on predicting customer conversion using various machine learning algorithms provided by Scikit-Learn. The dataset used for training and evaluation includes features such as age, job, marital status, education qualification, call type, day, month, call duration, number of calls, previous outcome, and the target variable indicating whether the customer converted or not.

#Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

age: The age of the customer

job: The occupation of the customer

marital: The marital status of the customer

education_qual: The education qualification of the customer

call_type: The type of call made to the customer

day: The day of the week when the call was made

mon: The month when the call was made

dur: The duration of the call in seconds

num_calls: The number of calls made to the customer

prev_outcome: The outcome of the previous marketing campaign

y: The target variable indicating whether the customer converted (yes or no)

#Models

The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the dataset using scikit-learn:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

XGBoost

Random Forest

Usage

#To use the customer conversion prediction models, follow these steps:

Prepare the dataset: Ensure that your dataset is in the correct format and contains the required features.

Train the models: Use the provided machine learning algorithms from scikit-learn to train the models on your dataset.

Evaluate the models: Assess the performance of each trained model based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or AUROC score. Implement the evaluation using appropriate techniques like cross-validation or train-test split.

Choose the best model: Select the model that performs best based on the evaluation metrics of interest.

Make predictions: Utilize the selected model to make predictions on new data or unseen instances.
